  <h2>Integrating Autopsy with Blockchain for Steganography-Based Evidence Management in Cybercrime Investigations</h2>
</div>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The rising complexity of cybercrimes presents major challenges for digital forensic investigators in recovering, preserving, and authenticating critical evidence. Cybercriminals increasingly use advanced techniques such as <strong>steganography</strong> to conceal illicit data within digital images, making detection and analysis difficult. Traditional forensic tools can recover deleted files but often fail to ensure the <strong>integrity</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, and <strong>traceability</strong> of evidence throughout the investigative process.
</p>

<p>
This research, <strong>TraceForensics</strong>, addresses these challenges by integrating forensic analysis with <strong>blockchain technology</strong> to create a secure, immutable, and transparent framework for managing digital evidence—including detecting and analyzing steganography used to hide sensitive information. The system enables investigators to recover deleted files, extract hidden data through steganographic decoding, and securely store all case-related details on a blockchain ledger. By combining advanced forensic methods with blockchain’s immutability, TraceForensics ensures that evidence remains tamper-proof, traceable, and legally admissible. This prototype enhances the reliability and credibility of digital forensic investigations, promoting fair and effective legal proceedings.

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
In today’s digital age, the complexity of cybercrimes continues to escalate, posing severe challenges for cybersecurity and digital investigations. Criminals use sophisticated techniques to evade detection, making it increasingly difficult for forensic professionals to recover, verify, and preserve critical digital evidence. Among these techniques, <strong>steganography</strong>—the art of hiding information within multimedia files—has become a major concern, as it enables offenders to embed illicit data such as financial transactions or malicious payloads within harmless-looking images or videos.
</p>

<p>
Traditional forensic tools can retrieve deleted files but lack the ability to ensure continuous integrity and traceability of digital evidence. This gap poses legal and technical barriers to prosecuting cybercriminals and underscores the need for a more <strong>secure, transparent, and tamper-proof</strong> forensic framework.
</p>

<p>
Real-world incidents highlight this necessity. The <strong>Silk Road darknet marketplace</strong> case demonstrated how encrypted communications and steganographic messages hindered law enforcement investigations. Similarly, the <strong>2014 Sony Pictures cyberattack</strong> showed how attackers concealed malicious code within benign files, bypassing security systems and leaking sensitive corporate data. These incidents emphasize the urgency for advanced forensic mechanisms that can not only detect concealed information but also ensure the authenticity and admissibility of evidence.
</p>

<p>
To overcome these challenges, <strong>TraceForensics</strong> integrates forensic analysis tools such as <em>Autopsy</em> with blockchain technology. The system operates in two main stages: (1) recovering deleted or hidden files through forensic and steganographic analysis, and (2) securely recording all extracted evidence and case data on a blockchain ledger. Blockchain’s decentralized and immutable nature guarantees that digital evidence remains unaltered, verifiable, and traceable, creating a transparent and legally defensible chain of custody.

<p>
By merging the robustness of forensic analysis with blockchain’s security framework, TraceForensics strengthens the accuracy, integrity, and legal reliability of cybercrime investigations. This approach not only improves digital evidence management but also supports law enforceme
